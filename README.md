My attempt at scraping a South African property site www.property24.com for housing data. 

The Python Library Scrapy is used.

Currently the code only scrapes the data from the search results page. The idea is to expand this to follow the link of each lisitng to be followed and data to be scraped. 

The plan is to compare property prices based on various features for a given location. 

The project is still in the experimental phase with only housing sale prices scraped for the Western Cape. I am sure there is plenty of improvement to be made to this code.

The idea is to conduct some data manupulation with Pandas. This has not been started yet. 

The data is sorted according to location and saved in an Excel document.
